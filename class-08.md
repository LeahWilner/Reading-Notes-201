## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  
You can only control one axis  

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.  
The main axis is set by the flex diection, the cross axis is the other direction. EX: if main axis is horizontal, cross axis will be vertical  

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?  
The visual display should match the order in the html document, otherwise screenreaders will not read the correct object and sight-impaired humans can't navigate the page

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?  
Floats are limited and difficult to work with, it can take a long time trying to position elements and then have to redo the styling for code updates

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?  
I think its important for modern responsive web design. It's frustrating when you are trying to use a website and its not coded for a mobile viewport because things are in a container and you can't even click them or move away from the element.
