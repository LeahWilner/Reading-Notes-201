## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?  
conversational turn-taking, empathy, and social sensitivity  

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.  
I previously had a direct report whose spouse had terminal cancer. It was a very difficult situation and I did my best to support her through it. I don't think she really had a support system so I referred her to resources including a local cancer support group and the company EAP. She took leave and my boss used the opportunity to fill her position as she didn't qualify for FMLA job protection due to her part-time status. Objectively speaking, she was hired above her skill level and wasn't trainable to meet the job requirements, but replacing her as she lost her husband showed a complete lack of empathy by my boss.  

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?  
They are more successful and tend to perform well across a variety of projects
